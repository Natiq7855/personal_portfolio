        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>I am a first-year Computer Engineering student at ADA University 
            with a strong interest in software development, web design, and 
            digital creativity. I have experience working with Python, 
            HTML/CSS, and basic C++, and I regularly use Adobe Photoshop and 
            Illustrator for design projects. Beyond academic coursework, 
            I have built small websites, practiced coding through personal 
            projects, and explored problem-solving through algorithms and 
            hands-on experimentation. I enjoy learning new technologies, 
            taking on creative challenges, and developing skills that will 
            help me grow into a capable and innovative engineer. My goal is 
            to continue expanding my technical foundation and apply my 
            knowledge to real-world projects and future opportunities.</p>
